# Cluster
A cluster is a group of satellites that are run together. They are defined in a YAML file and executed as a single job. You can define a cluster in a YAML file and deploy it on ExosphereHost infrastructure within minutes.

Adding more examples to this section to make clusters clearer. Further, we are working on Pythonic control flow to make clusters more flexible and powerful.
