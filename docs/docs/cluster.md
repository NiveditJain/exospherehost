A group of satellites that are run together, they are defined in a yaml file and are run together in a single job is called a cluster, you can define a cluster in a yaml file and deploy it on exospherehost infrastructure within minutes. 

Adding more example to this section to make cluster more clear, further we are working on pythonic control flow to make cluster more flexible and powerful.
